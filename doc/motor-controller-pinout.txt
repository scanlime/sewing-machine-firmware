Motor controller pinout:

1/ORG. +6V Regulated Out
2/RED. +6V Regulated Out
3/BRN. Ground
4/BLK. Ground
5WHT. Direction
6/GRY. Brake
7/PUR. PWM
8/BLU. Thermal flag out
9/GRN. Current sense out
10. N/C

NOTES:
  - Leave thermal flag and current sense disconnected.
    They aren't being used, and they are huge noise sources.

  - All signals (dir, brake, pwm) connected via 3.3k resistors,
    to limit the current of transients that come into the uC
    via these pins. (Ideally I'd have a better grounding layout,
    and maybe even opto-isolate these.)

  - Also, brake and dir turned out to be useless. But they're
    still connected at the moment.
